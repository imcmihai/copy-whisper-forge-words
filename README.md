# Internship Submission — Vibe Coding Role
Hi Nate! Hope you came across this file.

I’m Mihai — a young builder who's serious about AI and automation. 

## What I'll build for you

In week one, I’ll fully implement the research and content-generation automations outlined in my email, so you won’t need to hunt for news or draft ideas manually. You’ll just review what the AI writes and hit publish.

To optimize even further, I’ll map your current workflow: what tools you use, how you interact with your audience, where you source content for TikToks/Substack, and what takes up your time. From there, I’ll independently identify and prototype high-impact automations — whether it’s a mini CRM, a CMS-like post manager, scheduled social content, or smart filtering of DMs and emails. If it slows you down, I’ll try to speed it up.

Down below is a link to another application that I have built. Unfortunately, it is not working, due to the fact that the core backend logic is inside Supabase Edge Functions and Supabase is limiting me to two projects: CopyAir and another one that I'm working on at the moment.
This application's core purpose is to break down the user's ideea and help him develop it, market it and find competitors, by giving instructions and tips.
