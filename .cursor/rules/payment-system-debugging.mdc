Debugging Plan: Subscription Payment Processing Error
Issue Summary


After users complete Stripe payment for subscription upgrades, Supabase logs show a Deno runtime error preventing access to paid features:

####For every stage of this debugging process, I need you to dive deeply into each problem, think about the best solutions, and provide accurate fixes

Error: Deno.core.runMicrotasks() is not supported in this environment
Debugging Approach

##1. Payment Flow Analysis
Map the complete user journey from subscription selection to feature access
Identify where the error occurs in this sequence
Review Stripe webhook configuration and event handling
##2. Environment Compatibility Check
Examine any code using Node.js APIs in Deno environment (likely in Edge Functions)
Check for inappropriate mixing of Node and Deno runtime features
Review the event handling mechanism around page unload events
##3. Error Reproduction
Create controlled test cases that consistently trigger the error
Add detailed logging before/after critical steps in payment processing
Capture complete request/response data during Stripe interactions
##4. Database Verification
Confirm if subscription data is properly stored despite the error
Check for database triggers or functions that might contribute to the issue
Verify user permission updates post-payment
##5. Solution Implementation
Replace incompatible Node.js APIs with Deno-compatible alternatives
Consider moving webhook processing to appropriate environment
Implement proper error handling with fallback mechanisms
