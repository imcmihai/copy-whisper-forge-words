##1. Purpose
To enhance the user experience and copy quality by allowing users to select a copywriting framework (e.g., AIDA, PAS, BAB) before filling out the copy generation form. This ensures that generated text follows a proven structure, and makes the process more intuitive and educational for users.

##2. User Flow
Current Flow:
Dashboard → Form Page → Generated Copy Chat

New Flow:
Dashboard → Frameworks Page → Form Page → Generated Copy Chat

Details:

When a user clicks any “New Copy” button (from dashboard, chat history, or elsewhere), they are first taken to the Frameworks Page.
On the Frameworks Page, the user selects a copywriting framework (e.g., AIDA, PAS, BAB, etc.).
After selecting a framework, the user is taken to the Form Page, where they fill in the usual details (niche, product, tone, etc.).
When the user submits the form, the selected framework’s prompt is injected into the main prompt sent to ChatGPT for text generation.
The generated copy and chat refinement process remain unchanged.

##3. Core Features
a. Frameworks Page
List of Frameworks: Display all available frameworks as cards or a list, each with a name, description, and example.
Selection: User can select one framework before proceeding.
Continue Button: After selection, user clicks “Continue” to proceed to the Form Page.

Great for product descriptions, landing pages, and testimonials—anywhere you want to highlight the positive change your solution brings.

4. Feature-Advantage-Benefit (FAB)
Description:
FAB breaks down your product’s features, explains the advantages of those features, and then highlights the direct benefits to the user.

b. Frameworks Data Structure
Array of Objects: Each framework is an object with:
id: Unique identifier (e.g., "aida")
name: Framework name (e.g., "AIDA")
description: Short explanation for users
use case: the use cases specified above
prompt: The prompt template for ChatGPT
c. Prompt Injection
The prompts for the frameworks should be dynamically injected in the prompt from the *generate-copywriting* supabase edge function, situated inside */supabase/generate-copywriting/index.tsx
d. State Management
The selected framework is stored in state (e.g., React context, Redux, or URL param) and passed to the form and chat components.

##4. Technical Requirements
Frontend:
New FrameworksPage component
Update “New Copy” buttons to route to /frameworks instead of /copywriting-form
Store selected framework in state/context
Pass selected framework to Form Page and then to the chat generation logic


**Prompt Management:
The prompts for the frameworks should be dynamically injected in the prompt from the *generate-copywriting* supabase edge function, situated inside */supabase/generate-copywriting/index.tsx

##5. Example Frameworks Array


const frameworks = [
  {
    id: "aida",
    name: "AIDA",
    description: "Attention, Interest, Desire, Action – a classic formula for persuasive copy.",
    example: "Attention: Struggling to write copy? Interest: Our AI makes it easy...",
    prompt: `
Write a [text format] for [product name] targeting [target audience] using the AIDA framework.

- Attention: [Grab attention]
- Interest: [Build interest]
- Desire: [Create desire]
- Action: [Call to action]

Tone: [tone]
Keywords: [keywords]
    `
  },
  // ...other frameworks
];
##6. Acceptance Criteria
User is always taken to the Frameworks Page before the Form Page when starting a new copy.
Frameworks Page displays all available frameworks with descriptions and examples.
User cannot proceed to the Form Page without selecting a framework.
The selected framework’s prompt is correctly injected into the main prompt for text generation.
The generated copy follows the selected framework’s structure.
The flow is seamless and intuitive, with clear navigation and state management.




##7.Design Notes
Frameworks Page should be visually engaging, with icons or illustrations for each framework.
Provide tooltips or info modals for users who want to learn more about each framework.
